Music Project 2024_12_27__attempt_2 Notes

---------------------------------
2025-01-08
- Finished gathering the country music data
 - metadata collection didn't work (those fields didn't get captured in the metadata) but shouldn't need that for what we're doing

- Now run the model on affinity, differentiating yours from country

---------------------------------
2025-01-07

-Extracted features from AC, TMOE, The Strokes, and Pogo
- RF and KNN to see accuracy (no hypertuning)
 - RF did well
- Plotted using UMAP

Further development:
- It would be interesting to throw some very disparate data in here (country?) to see where it falls.
 - that could help tell if having large amounts of data in here, we could still lasso together the stuff we like (find the affinity)
 - so far, we like all of these songs, so throw some in here we don't like, then build a clf on that?
