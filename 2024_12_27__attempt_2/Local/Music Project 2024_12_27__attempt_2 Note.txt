Music Project 2024_12_27__attempt_2 Notes

---------------------------------
2025-01-08
- Finished gathering the country music data
 - metadata collection didn't work (those fields didn't get captured in the metadata) but shouldn't need that for what we're doing

- Ran a model on affinity, differentiating mine from country
 - results were pretty good. see the notebook (Analysis\2025_01_08__local_vs_country.ipynb) for more details
 - might have something here

- Maybe a long shot, but what if we had a playlist of all of our likes, and started building one on all of our dislikes, then trained on that, inferred on new music?

-Extracted features from AC, TMOE, The Strokes, and Pogo
- RF and KNN to see accuracy (no hypertuning)
 - RF did well
- Plotted using UMAP

Further development:
- It would be interesting to throw some very disparate data in here (country?) to see where it falls.
 - that could help tell if having large amounts of data in here, we could still lasso together the stuff we like (find the affinity)
 - so far, we like all of these songs, so throw some in here we don't like, then build a clf on that?
